This fortran code is for Burger's Equation. It has been found that expressing conservation laws in the divergence form is not necessary for discrete conservation. This code utilizes a skew-symmetric splitting of the u*du/dx term for various initial conditions involving discontinuities. The code has 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th order capabilities as well as several different boundary conditions and RK schemes. Injection and simultaneous approximation term boundary conditions are available, as well as a 3 stage 3rd order RK scheme and a 5 stage 4th order RK scheme.
